<h1>OUR PROMISE</h1>
<h2>

2. To always remember that every child's life is priceless and to put the needs of the children above our own.</br>
3. To uphold the highest ethical standards in our work and to be honest and accountable in our reports about those we help.</br>
4. To recognize that none of our work is possible without the support of our donors, friends and volunteers.</br>
