<h3>
	Education is a critical foundation in every child's life. It is certainly something that we place great value in.
	As a result, it has always been an ambitious dream of ours to build a comprehensive school campus for our orphanage. 
	In its finished form, our school, the Maxton Strong School will include multiple buildings and provide education
	 from nursery up to college level. Our goal is to provide the highest-quality education at an affordable price,
	  not just for our children but for the children of our local community. There are other schools in our area,
	   but they are all profit-making endeavors; costs are cut at every opportunity, and sadly, the quality of 
	   education is sacrificed along the way.
</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>

Public education in India is a grim option. Most government schools run in Hindi medium and teach very 
little English, computers, math or science. Our school operates in an English medium with separate classes
 for Hindi Language, Hindi Literature and Sanskrit. For a excellent private high school education, it costs 
 between $500 and $1800 per student per year, with quality and school reputation being the biggest factors 
 in determining cost. Considering the fact that many families operate on combined incomes of less than $200
  per month, an education of this type is often well beyond their means. We feel that all children, including
   our own, deserve a chance at something better.</br></br></br></br>
